The code is thoroughly commented so that every step of the implementation is understood.

Besides the predefined functions found in the template and needed to resolve the assignment I've implemented 3 functions that helped me while figuring the solution.

char* parse_input(char* string)
	- receives a single argument: a pointer to a string that contains both the encoded message and the key
	(separated by 0x00)
	- the pointer to the key is returned in eax

int get_length(char* string)
	- receives a single argument: a pointer to a string finished with a null terminator 
	- return the length of the string in eax

void hex_to_ binary(char* character)
	- receives a character (in hexa) and changes it to the equivalent value, but in binary
	- the change is done in place. This function does not return anything

The rest of the code can be easily understood from my comments.
