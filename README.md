# This was a homework received at "Introduction to computers structure and assembly languages" course.
 The program was designed to read an encoded text and decypher it or vice-versa, in assembly x86.
 Its purpose was to introduce us to some encryption and decrytion techniques like: 
	- Vigenere Cipher
	- Bruteforcing
	- Base32 encodings
	- XOR encryptions
